<p>Earlier this week, we introduced a set of updates to our privacy policy and terms of service to help our users better understand our service.In the days since, it became clear that we failed to fulfill what I consider one of our most important responsibilities â€“ to communicate our intentions clearly.I am sorry for that, and I am focused on making it right.The concerns we heard about from you the most focused on advertising, and what our changes might mean for you and your photos.There was confusion and real concern about what our possible advertising products could look like and how they would work.</p>
