<p>We are excited to announce support for webhooks which allow you to capture real-time data/requests coming from ActiveCampaign to use in other applications.Overview Webhooks differ from our standard API in that they are event-driven, meaning they automatically run behind the scenes whenever a particular event happens in the system (such as a campaign sending, or a subscriberâ€™s details being updated), whereas our standard API requires that you initiate the requests to receive data.Webhooks allow a much more fluid exchange of data between applications because they reduce the need for applications to poll for new data on a routine basis, which can be a waste of system resources.With webhooks, your applications can listen for new requests to come across, and only perform actions when a request arrives.Here is an overview of all available webhook types for ActiveCampaign: A new subscription occurs An unsubscription occurs When any of the above events happen, you can post the corresponding data to any URL.</p>
