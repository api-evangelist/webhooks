<p>After we posted the a list of NLP , Sentiment Analysis , and Machine Learning APIs a while ago, we noticed that some API descriptions require a little bit of digging into, to fully appreciate what these APIs can do. Here’s an example: Text analysis API including wordnet synsets,relation extraction,named entity recognition and classification,lemmatization,part of speech tagging,tokenization, and semantic role labeling.  If you’re not familiar with these words, you could totally miss the features that this API is capable of.To help with that, we have listed below an explanation to some of these words in the NLP/Machine Learning context; as well as APIs (represented as numbered links) whose descriptions mention these terms. Hopefully a basic understanding of these terms would help you appreciate what these APIs are capable of.</p>
