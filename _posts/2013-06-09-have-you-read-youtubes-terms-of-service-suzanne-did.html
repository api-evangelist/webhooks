<p>Dear reader, Im very pleased to introduce here Suzannes first blog commit about her work at ToS;DR.Suzanne studies law in Sciences Po where I also study, and shes doing an internship as part of her masters program.She has been very helpful for our collaboration with the BBC (more about that later!) and she has also provided analysis of several terms already, amongst them YouTubes, which we are proud to publish now: #youtube.-- Hugo When I first decided to contribute to the tos;dr project, my idea was to analyze and to work on the terms of service of youtube, since it had not been already rated while it is one of the most popular websites among people.</p>
