<p>Today we are publishing some changes for our Developer Rules of the Road and Developer Display Requirements.The main goal behind these changes is to better clarify our guidelines for using our API and other platform tools, based on your feedback and comments.For example: we relaxed some display requirements around author’s name, timestamps and permalinks; we clarified that the “no commingling” term doesn’t apply to manually curated streams; and, we now require developers to disclose their privacy policies before people download, install or sign up for a service.We have also clarified some restrictions: hosting datasets of raw Tweets for download is prohibited, and automated following or bulk following is also prohibited.We believe these changes will help provide a better experience for everyone using Twitter.</p>
