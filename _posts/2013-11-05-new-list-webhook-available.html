<p>We’ve added a webhook notification that runs whenever a new list is created for an ActiveCampaign account.Since the software is mainly driven by lists, this is useful if you need to be notified whenever a new list is created.Resellers utilizing common webhooks across all of their accounts will also benefit from this because all other webhooks require at least one list relation, meaning your accounts will always have the necessary hooks set up even when new lists are created in the future.Here is an example webhook payload that ActiveCampaign will send when a new list is created: type: list_add date_time: 2013-09-25 15:31:45 initiated_from: api initiated_by: api list[id]: 7 list[userid]: 1 list[name]: List 3 (API) list[sender_addr1]: 123 S.Street list[sender_addr2]: list[sender_city]: New York list[sender_state]: NY list[sender_zip]: 88383 list[sender_country]: USA list[sender_url]: http://test.</p>
